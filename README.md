# ContractMonthlyClaimSystem
Part One of my Programming 2B POE
Read me File for : Contract Monthly Claim System
Greetings and welcome to the Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS). The goal of this project is to create a useful.NET web application that will expedite the Independent Contractor (IC) lecturers' monthly claim submission and approval process.
The CMCS integrates a number of features and functionalities to improve the accuracy and efficiency of claim management. This project will give you an understanding of real-world situations and give you an opportunity to learn about C#.NET GUI development.
Project Goals:
This POE's main goal is to evaluate your comprehension of and ability to apply C# GUI development in a practical setting. The project is broken up into three phases, with the current phase concentrating on creating a CMCS prototype. This prototype ought to have the following components:
Using.NET Core for GUI User Interface (UI), UML Class Diagram for Databases, Project Plan, Windows Presentation Form, or Model View Controller (MVC)
Please be aware that the application is currently only a visual depiction of the suggested system and is not yet functioning as a prototype.
Documentation:
Here is where you will need to supply:
•	Design Decisions: An explanation of the choices you made, such as the GUI's layout and database structure. Add any limitations or presumptions that were thought of.
•	Database UML Class Diagram: An elaborate UML class diagram that illustrates the CMCS's data requirements. All necessary classes, attributes, and relationships should be shown in this diagram.
•	Project Plan: A list of the steps, deadlines, and dependencies involved in creating the prototype. Make sure the strategy is doable and practical.
GUI Design:
A user-friendly and intuitive GUI design should include the following features:
1.	Academic managers and program coordinators: the ability to confirm and authorize claims.
2.	Lecturers: The ability to upload supporting documentation and submit claims with a single click. Tracking of claim status ought to be open and visible.
3.	Consistency and Dependability: Make sure the system consistently delivers correct data.
Only a front-end prototype with the features mentioned should be provided by the GUI. Additional functionality will be included in later POE sections.
